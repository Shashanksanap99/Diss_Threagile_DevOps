# Threat Model As Code (TMAC)

This repository is an example of how Threat Modeling as Code is applied to examine the security environment of AWS infrastructure. 
Through the use of Infrastructure as Code (IAC), Threagile, and DevOps principles, the project automates threat modeling in the 
deployment pipeline. Teams may systematically discover, assess, and address possible threats in their AWS environments by 
incorporating security considerations directly into the DevOps process with IAC. By strengthening the AWS cloud infrastructure 
against vulnerabilities and integrating security practices seamlessly into the development lifecycle, this method empowers a 
proactive security attitude.
